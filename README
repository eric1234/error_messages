A crazy simple Rails add-on to handle displaying and styling of flash
messages and error messages. Includes:

  flash_messages helper::
    Will output all flash messages in a container to be easily styled

  error_messages.css::
    Included in your app to apply nice looking styles that most apps
    will find reasonable. Styles flash messages, the
    "error_messages_for" helper that Rails provides and the
    field_error_proc that highlights the problem fields

  error_messages.js::
    If you want to get fancy and have some of the flash messages fade
    shortly after displaying (nice for notices) include this in your
    application. NOTE: You MUST include prototype and script.aculo.us
    BEFORE you load this JS file.

  flash_type.png::
    For several of the common flash types our stylesheets refer to some
    images which help convey the message and look nice in most apps.

  field_error_proc::
    Replaces the default field_error_proc with a span based one since
    the div one often causes layout problems and invalid HTML.

  rake task::
    A rake task to copy the assets (CSS, JS, images) into the app

Since this plugin is mostly about establishing a look we don't have much
in the way of traditional unit testing but we do have a test page that
shows everything all laid out so you can adjust and tweak the styles.
This special page can be accessed via the path /error_messages and is
ONLY available if in the development environment.
