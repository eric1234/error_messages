A simple Rails add-on to handle displaying and styling of flash messages and
error messages. Includes:

  flash_messages helper::
    Will output all flash messages in a container to be easily styled

  error_messages.css::
    Applies nice looking styles that most apps will find reasonable. Provides
    styling for the flash messages and the popup validation messages.

  error_messages.js::
    For the inline popup message this will trigger the display and hiding
    of them as the fields get focus. Also for notice messages will slide the
    message away aftera few seconds if script.aculo.us is enabled.

  flash_type.png::
    For several of the common flash types our stylesheets refer to some
    images which help convey the message and look nice in most apps.

  field_error_proc::
    Replaces the default field_error_proc so that inline error messages are
    included on the page. Are hidden by default but the JavaScript will
    renable.

Since this plugin is mostly about establishing a look we don't have much
in the way of traditional unit testing but we do have a test page that
shows everything all laid out so you can adjust and tweak the styles.
This special page can be accessed via the path /error_messages and is
ONLY available if in the development environment.

Only Rails 3 is supported. For Rails 2.x support see version 0.0.2 of
this gem. Prior to Rails 3.1 you will need to copy the assets yourself.
